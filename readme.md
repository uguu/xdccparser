This xdccparser is a packlist indexer for [iroffer-dinoex][irod] irc bots. It is similar to the more well known [php xdccparser][xdccp] or dinoex's own [iroffer-state][irod].

The main difference from these is that it uses the client's browser to handle all of the data, rather than on the server. The main advantage of this is that it means a searchable packlisting can be provided without needing any special server setup.

That said, it requires a recent version of [iroffer-dinoex][irod] that has been built with ruby support.

Actual installation instructions to come.
